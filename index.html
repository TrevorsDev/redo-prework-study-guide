      <h3>Attributes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML attributes are additional values used to identify elements for CSS and Javascript, and to configure the
          behavior or display of an HTML element.</li>
        <li>They are placed inside the element's opening tag and consist of two parts: a name and a value.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoiding nesting lists deeper than three levels is a good rule of thumb</li>

      <ul>
        <h3>What is Git?</h3>
        <li>Git is a version control system that stores your code and its history, as well as separate versions of the
          code.</li>
        <li>It allows you to create "save points" (called commits) of your work. It's good practice to
          commit your work whenever you reach a good stopping point. This creates a history of changes and allows you to
          revert to an earlier version if necessary.</li>
        <h3>CLI</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How to navigate through directories and files, create a new folder</li>
          <li>the <b>ls</b> command will allow us to see a list of files within our current directory</li>
          <li>The <b>pwd</b> (print working directory) will print the current directory to the terminal</li>
          <li>The <b>cd</b> command allows us to change directories <b>cd ..</b> will allow us to navigate backwards one
            directory at a time.
            and <b>cd .</b> will move you forward in a directory</li>
          <li>Command <b>mkdir</b> will create a new directory to store files in. Ex: /Users/<username>/<b>bootcamp</b>
          </li>
          <li>The <b>touch </b>command will create a new file inside the current directory. Ex: <b>index.html</b> inside
            <b>bootcamp</b> directory.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>SSH Keys</h3>

          you have SSH keys? - GitHub</a>
        <h4>How to Check</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter <b>ls -al ~/.ssh</b> in terminal. Look for a public SSH key that ends in <b>.pub</b>.Ex:
            <b>id_ed25519.pub</b>
          </li>
          <li>If an "error" occurs, you need ot generate a new SSH key pair</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Generating an SSH Key</h4>

          href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key">Generating
          a New SSH Key</a> - GitHub
        <ul>
          <li>Heres a Steps Summary</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Enter <b>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C “your_email@example.com”</b> in your terminal to create a new SSH key.
            </li>
            <li>When prompted, save your key in the default file location and create a secure passphrase.</li>
          </ol>
        </ul>

        <h4>Adding the New SSH Key to the ssh-agent</h4>
        <p>Once you have your SSH keys, you can add them to the ssh-agent by reading <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent">How
            to Add SSH Key to ssh-agent - GitHub</a>. The <b>ssh-agent</b> is a program that keeps track of a user's
          identity keys and passphrases.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Heres a Steps Summary</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Enter <b>eval “$(ssh-agent -s)”</b> in your terminal to start the ssh-agent.</li>
            <li>Add your private SSH key to the <b>ssh-agent</b> using the <b>ssh-add</b> command.</li>
          </ol>
        </ul>

        <h4>Add the SSH Key to GitHub</h4>
        <p>Read <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer">
            this article</a> on how to set your Git username for every repository on your computer - GitHub</p>
        <ul>
          <p>You can add your newly generated SSH key to your GitHub account by reading <a
              href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">
              this GitHub article</a></p>
          <li>Heres a Steps Summary</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>Copy the public SSH key to your clipboard. Be sure not to copy anything else after this point so that your
            SSH key stays on your clipboard!</li>
          <li>Navigate to the GitHub website and log in to your account.</li>
          <li>Click on Settings, and then click on SSH and GPG keys.</li>
          <li>Add your SSH key.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Set Your Git Username for Every Repository on Your Computer</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Git uses a username to associate any commits, or changes, to your code with an identity. The Git username
            is different from your GitHub username.</li>
          <li>You can change the name that's associated with your Git commits using the <b>git config</b> command.</li>
          <li> Changing the name associated with your Git commits using git config will only affect future commits and
            will not change the name used for past commits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Did you Connect it Successfully?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>To test if you've set up your SSH connection correctly, enter <b>ssh -T git@github.com</b> into your
            terminal.</li>
          <li>Verify that the fingerprint in the message matches the GitHub’s RSA public key fingerprint. If yes, you're
            connected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Git Flow</h3>
        <h4>Version Control</h4>
        <p>What is version control?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Version control is the practice of tracking changes to our code. With tracking, if we make changes to our
            code and decide that we don’t want to keep them or that they have a bug, we can easily revert to an earlier
            version of the code. Version control also makes our code more forgiving to mistakes because we can easily
            access and restore past versions.</li>
          <li>How to Practice Version Control</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Inspect the workflow or code in concern:</li>
            <li>Identify where the bug happened in the workflow.</li>
            <li>dentify the SHA of the version the team should revert to so that they can make a fix and complete the
              <b>git revert</b> command.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <li>An SHA, or hash, is actually a long string of numbers or letters, like this:
            "e0eaed45609ae40ada29664384e679ada5d5004a." However, when using the SHA to access a version of their code,
            developers often type out only the first seven numbers or letters.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>

          <h4>Creating a GitHub Repository with a README File</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Log into GitHub account</li>
            <li>Click the plus sign in the top bar next to your profile picture.</li>
            <li>Select "New Repository" from the dropdown menu.</li>
            <li>Give the repository a name. Ex: <b>prework-study-guide</b>. Remember these when naming:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Be unique and descriptive for each repository name.</li>
              <li>Use all lowercase letters.</li>
              <li>Use dashes; we can't have spaces in our repository names, so we use dashes instead.</li>
              <li>Be consistent! Our GitHub account will follow us throughout our web development career.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Add a description to your repository. Be concise and clear with your project descriptions.</li>
            <li>Select our repository to be public or private</li>
            <li>Add a README file.</li>
            <li>Give your repo a license, or not...</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>GitHub Issues and Markedown</h4>
          <p>GitHub offers a task management tool called GitHub issues, which gives developers and teams an easy way to
            keep track of key tasks and progress. Its like a to-do list.</p>
          <p>Issues help teams:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Track, organize, and communicate ideas, tasks, bugs, and enhancements.</li>
            <li>Identify bottlenecks or blockers that could prevent work progress.</li>
            <li>Avoid duplicating work by assigning tasks or issues.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Follow the git flow steps to add, commit, and push our work to our feature branch.</li>
          <li>Then we open a pull request with my feature branch as the comparison branch and the default branch as the
            base branch, merge changes with the main branch, and close the associated GitHub issue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Git, and Git Commands</h4>
        <p>Git is the most widely used version control system, enabling tracking of changes to files and easier
          collaboration among multiple users.</p>
        <li><b>Git status</b>: checks what branch we are currently on </li>
        <li>The <b>git</b> command must precede every Git statement.</li>
        <li>The <b>checkout</b> command is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>
        <li><b>Git checkout -b branch-name</b>: creates a new branch and switches to it. </li>
        <li>The "branch name", ex: 'feature/starter-code' is the name of the new branch. We have added the prefix,
          feature, to indicate that it is a feature. It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will
          be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>
        <li>To code to the current working branch, ex: 'feature/starter-code', we'll need to do the
          following:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>git add -A</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area.</li>
            <li>The <b>-A</b> flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Now that we have staged those files to be committed, let’s enter the git commit command with a commit
            message that describes what the commit contains. Ex:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>git commit -m "add starter code"</b></li>
          </ul>
          <li>Before we push this up to our repo, we should double-check if our local branch is in sync with the base
            branch in GitHub. So let’s pull down any changes from the base branch.:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>git pull origin main</b></li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>In Git, a commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the codebase at a specific point in time. A commit is
          a permanent and unchangeable record of the changes made to the codebase. A commit represents a single point in
          the history of the codebase.A stage, on the other hand, is a temporary holding area for changes that have been
          made to the codebase, but have not yet been committed. When you stage changes in Git, you are preparing them
          for a commit, but you have not yet made the commit. This allows you to review your changes and make sure they
          are correct before committing them.You can think of a commit as a final version of the changes and a stage as
          a draft version of the changes.</li>
